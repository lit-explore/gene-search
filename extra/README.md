# Additional Helper Scripts

This directory contains some helper scripts that can be used to generate data used by gene-search:

- `create_ensgene_entrez_mappings.py` - Uses [BioThings](https://biothings.io/) to create a mapping
  from _Ensembl_ gene identifiers to _Entrez_ gene identifiers.
- `create_symbol_entrez_mappings.py` - Uses [BioThings](https://biothings.io/) to create a mapping
  from approved HUGO gene _symbols_ to _Entrez_ gene identifiers.
